# CalcuChain - A Blockchain-powered calculator
## _Because, why not!?_

CalcuChain is a calculator written in Solidity and runs on the Ethereum Blockchain. 
We are still in the early pre-release era. CalcuChain's smart contract currently has the following features: 
- âœ¨Addition - get the sum of two numbers.  
- ...yeah that is all at the moment!

Although the Smart Contract is fully functional, it should be pretty obvious that this repository is only being used for my personal Solidity learning journey.
